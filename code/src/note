## Objective function

C set of classes
c element of C
B set of possible Bids
P set of possible Prices

n(c, bid) = number of daily clicks of class c, given the bid
cost(bid) = cost per click, given the bid
cr(c, price) = conversion rate for class c, given the price
comebacks(c) = discrete random variable of the number a user of class c will come back to buy the item
